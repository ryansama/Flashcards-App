# Flashcards App (Console)
This is the console implementation of [Desktop Flashcards](https://github.com/ryansama/Desktop-Flashcards), a program app that I built with [theandyyang](https://github.com/theandyyang) using C# in Visual Studio 2015. Testing is in process to determine which data structure ([Hashtable](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/hashtable-solution) or [Linked List](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/linkedlist-solution)) is more time and space efficient.
