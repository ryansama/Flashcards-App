# Flashcards App (Console)

Testing is in process to determine which data structure ([Hashtable](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/hashtable-solution) or [Linked List](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/linkedlist-solution)) is more time and space efficient.
