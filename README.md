# Flashcards App (Console)
This is the console implementation of [Desktop Flashcards](https://github.com/ryansama/Desktop-Flashcards), a Windows Forms desktop app that I built with @theandyyang using C# in Visual Studio 2015. We completed testing to determine which data structure ([Hashtable](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/hashtable-solution) or [Linked List](https://github.com/ryansama/Flashcards-Console-App/tree/linkedlist-solution)) is more time and space efficient. We concluded that the Linked List can populate a collection of Card objects faster, and that there was no significant difference in access times. Therefore, we implemented the Linked List in the program and decided to use it in the final Windows Forms desktop ap.
